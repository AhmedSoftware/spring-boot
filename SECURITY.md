Please, [open a draft security advisory](https://github.com/spring-projects/security-advisories/security/advisories/new) if you need to disclose and discuss a security issue in private with the Spring Boot team. Note that we only accept reports against [supported versions](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support).

For more details, check out our [security policy](https://spring.io/security-policy).
