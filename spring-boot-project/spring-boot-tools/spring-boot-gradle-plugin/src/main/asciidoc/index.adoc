== Introduction

The Spring Boot Gradle Plugin provides Spring Boot support in https://gradle.org[Gradle],
allowing you to package executable jar or war archives, run Spring Boot applications, and
use the dependency management provided by `spring-boot-dependencies`. Spring Boot's
Gradle plugin requires Gradle 4.4 or later. If you choose to use the newer Kotlin DSL,
it requires Gradle 4.10 or later.

In addition to this user guide, {api-documentation}[API documentation] is also available.
