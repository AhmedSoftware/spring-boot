== Spring Boot Mail Sample

This sample demonstrates a basic use of spring-boot-starter-mail.

Fill in src/main/resources/application.properties with your email and password.
(Also, host and port when necessary).

Note:
If you are using gmail with 2-Step-Verification enabled, you need to either temporarily disable it, or setup App Passwords.
